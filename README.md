# Logdensor - Distributed Log Analysis System

Logdensor is a Core Java project designed to process and analyze large volumes of distributed log files (5GB+), such as those generated by microservices or servers.

## 📊 Features

- Parse logs into structured data (timestamp, level, message, metadata)
- Compute metrics:
  - Event count by log level (INFO, ERROR, WARN, etc.)
  - Peak traffic hours
  - Frequent error messages
  - Login–logout duration per user
  - Anomaly detection (e.g., error spikes)
- Multi-threaded log file processing
- Export reports in JSON, CSV, Excel formats
- Filter reports by:
  - Log level (e.g., ERROR)
  - Message tags (e.g., "job created", "login success")
  - Time ranges

## 🚀 How to Run

### ✅ Option 1: Cross-Platform (Terminal)

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=com.logdensor.Main"
```

### 🪟 Option 2: Windows

```bash
# Double-click run.bat
# Or in PowerShell/CMD:

```

### 🍎🐧 Option 3: macOS / Linux

```bash
chmod +x run.sh (only once)
./run.sh
```

## 📂 Output Files

All reports are saved to `/reports/` folder:

- `summary.json`, `summary.csv`, `summary.xlsx`
- `filtered-error-only.json`
- `filtered-warn-only.json`
- `filtered-tag-job-created.json`
- `filtered-tag-login-success.json`
- `filtered-time-range.json`

## 🧪 Testing

Run all unit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Includes tests for parsing, metrics, filtering, and report generation.
